-- $twopartyswap
-- The two-party swap is a fully manual exchange of values between two
-- parties.  Each one has the chance to verify the other's offering before
-- approving the swap; if either disagrees, both can get their offering
-- back; if both agree, each one gets the other's.

-- | The exceptions that can arise during a swap, constraining the possible
-- flow of the decision and its consequences.

instance Exception TwoPartyException

-- | This function accepts both offerings on creation; the intention is
-- that it is created in a single transaction signed jointly by both
-- parties, who withdraw their values from their respective "accounts".
--
-- The result of calling @'twoPartySwap' itemA itemB@ in a transaction
-- signed by two parties "partyA" and "partyB"  is that a contract is
-- created with signature
--
-- > Contract (Maybe Bool) (Maybe (Either (Versioned a) (Versioned b)))
--
-- that possesses both items.  This contract has two phases; in each one,
-- the party performing the action must sign the transaction as "self".
--
-- 1. Approval: each party may submit an argument of the form @Just True@
-- or @Just False@ to indicate if they approve or, respectively, disapprove
-- of the swap.  Only one vote is allowed per party, and a successful vote
-- returns 'Nothing'.
--
-- 2. Retrieval: This phase begins when either one party votes 'False' or
-- both parties vote 'True'.  Each party may call the contract once with
-- 'Nothing' to retrieve the item they are owed.  If there was a 'False'
-- vote, they get their own item back; if not, they get the other's item.
-- Either way, "partyA" gets the 'Left' value and "partyB" gets the
-- 'Right'.
--
-- Once both items are returned, the contract is deleted.

-- $vendor
-- Direct sales are contracts in which the seller delivers the product
-- automatically, allowing Fae-powered stores.  This requires the seller as
-- well as the buyer to sign the transaction (like the two-party swap),
-- which can be automated by whatever front-end interface manages the sale.
--
-- These "contracts" are all actually escrows deposited in the name of the
-- seller.  The prospective buyer writes a transaction that the seller must
-- also sign, allowing them to obtain the escrow and provide the desired
-- form of payment.
