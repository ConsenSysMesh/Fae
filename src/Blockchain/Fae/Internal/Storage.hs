-- * Types

-- | 'StorageT' is just an association between transactions and what they did.
newtype Storage = Storage { getStorage :: Map TransactionID TransactionEntry }

-- | Each transaction can produce outputs in two different ways (cf.
-- 'ContractID'), has an associated "signer" public key, and a result.
--
-- The technical reason for separating 'inputOutputs' from 'outputs' is
-- that it makes it possible for contracts to create new contracts without
-- putting a global lock on the storage; thunk execution will go straight
-- to the correct contract's outputs and not require evaluation of any
-- other contract or transaction.
data TransactionEntry =
  TransactionEntry 
  {
    inputOutputs :: InputOutputs,
    inputOrder :: [ShortContractID],
    outputs :: Outputs,
    txSigners :: Signers,
    result :: Result
  }

-- | The result can be anything, but should be 'show'able so that it has
-- outside meaning.  This is an existential type, so the record names are
-- just there for documentation; values have to be extracted by
-- pattern-matching.
data Result = forall a. (Show a) => Result a

-- | Inputs are identified by 'ShortContractID's so that 'ContractIDs' of
-- the 'InputOutput' variant can be flat, rather than nested potentially
-- indefinitely.
type InputOutputs = Map ShortContractID InputOutputVersions
-- | We save the versions map, with the actual values scrubbed, so that it
-- can be displayed to learn the actual version IDs.
data InputOutputVersions =
  InputOutputVersions
  {
    iRealID :: ContractID,
    iOutputs :: Outputs,
    iVersions :: VersionRepMap
  }
  deriving (Generic)
-- | Outputs are ordered by creation.  However, contracts can be deleted,
-- and deletion must preserve the original ordering index of the remaining
-- contracts, so it's not enough to just store them in a sequence.  In case
-- the outputs of several input calls need to be combined, the original
-- count of outputs needs to be retained.  The
-- second component of the map entries is the "nonce" of a contract, the
-- number of times it has been called, used for security.
data Outputs = 
  Outputs

    outputMap :: IntMap (AbstractGlobalContract, Int),
    outputCount :: Int

-- | Unions the outputs and the versions of the two arguments.  The failure
-- mode is when the arguments have a different 'iRealID', in which case we
-- choose the second one for the result.  This is because in "Transaction",
-- the second argument is the old entry, and we want to prevent people from
-- screwing up contract calls by way of subsequent calls.  This is
-- extraordinarily unlikely anyway, the way that the module works currently,
-- since to do so would require manufacturing a hash collision for the
-- short IDs.  If that happens, the later contract call is /definitely/
-- malicious, and so it's okay to mishandle it.
