Stability: experimental

Fae does not have an associated currency, but it does provide a very
minimal valuable to certain transactions that can be exchanged for currency
or other derived values.

-- * Types

-- | The system-managed reward value.  Not constructible directly.
data RewardValue = Value deriving (Generic)
-- | Private token controlling a 'RewardEscrowID'.
data RewardToken = Token deriving (Generic)
-- | The identifier for reward escrows
data RewardName = RewardName deriving (Generic)
-- | An opaque type containing the escrow ID of a reward token provided by
-- the system.
newtype Reward = Reward (EscrowID RewardName) deriving (Generic)

-- | The argument and value types are both private types (not exported by
-- "Blockchain.Fae"), so that a reward contract cannot be called directly
-- by users; instead, they must use the interface, which consists only of
-- 'claimReward', which only destroys a reward and does not create them.
-- So the supply of 'Reward's is limited to those transactions that are
-- marked to receive them as special input values.

  theContract RewardName = rewardContract

-- | This is global to support the 'ContractName' instance
rewardContract :: Contract RewardToken RewardValue
rewardContract Token = spend Value

-- | This function destroys a reward token, validating it in the process.
-- As the only interface to the `Reward` type, this /must/ be used by any
-- contract that intends to accept rewards as payment.
