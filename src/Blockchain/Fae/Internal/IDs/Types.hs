Description: Identifier types

Stability: experimental

There are several identifier types in Fae: two kinds of contract ID (one
detailed, one convenient but lossy), transaction IDs, escrow IDs, and
version IDs.

-- explicitly but only as a transaction input, for which there is a special
-- syntax outside Haskell.

-- import more modules in the interpreter to get 'Map'.

-- | This identifier locates an escrow.  Escrow IDs are assigned when the
-- escrow is first created and are guaranteed to be globally unique and
-- immutable.  Each escrow ID is valid only within a contract or other
-- escrow that actually holds the escrow, which must have been created with
-- a "name" type matching the phantom type parameter.  Escrow IDs may only
-- be constructed by the 'newEscrow' function; in contract calls, they can
-- also be referenced by version (see "Versions").  However, they should
-- appear type-correct in contract signatures to formally verify that the
-- contract receives and returns a particular kind of opaque value, e.g.
-- a currency.
