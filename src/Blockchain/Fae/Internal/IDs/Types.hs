Description: Identifier types

Stability: experimental

There are several identifier types in Fae: two kinds of contract ID (one
detailed, one convenient but lossy), transaction IDs, escrow IDs, and
version IDs.

-- | This identifier locates a contract in storage.  It is not intended to
-- be used in contract code, as indeed, a contract can never be called
-- explicitly but only as a transaction input, for which there is a special
-- syntax outside Haskell.
data ContractID =
  -- | One way contracts can be created is by being directly output by
  -- a transaction.  The outputs are indexed from 0 in order of creation.
  TransactionOutput TransactionID Int |
  -- | The other way contracts can be created is by being output during the
  -- execution of one of its input contract calls.  The outputs are indexed
  -- from 0 in order of creation, with the indexing specific to each input
  -- contract.

  -- times they have been called.  This infix constructor is for
  -- convenience.

-- otherwise be unboundedly long chains of contracts that are outputs of
-- contracts that are outputs of ... that are outputs of some long-ago
-- transaction.

  deriving (Eq, Ord, Serialize, IsString, Generic, NFData)

-- | Transactions can have many named signatories, which are available in

-- | This identifier locates an escrow.  Escrow IDs are assigned when the
-- escrow is first created and are guaranteed to be globally unique and
-- immutable.  Each escrow ID is valid only within a contract or other
-- escrow that actually holds the escrow, and the type parameters must
-- correspond to the escrow's actual argument and value types.  Escrow IDs
-- may only be constructed by the 'newEscrow' function; in contract calls,
-- they can also be referenced by version (see "Versions").  However, they
-- should appear type-correct in contract signatures to formally verify
-- that the contract receives and returns a particular kind of opaque
-- value, e.g. a currency.

-- | So we can get a 'ShortContractID' from a regular one.

-- | 'ShortContractID's and, by extension, 'TransactionIDs', are read as
-- the digests they wrap.
instance Read ShortContractID where

-- | 'ShortContractID's and, by extension, 'TransactionIDs', show as hex
-- strings.  This should be inverse to the 'Read' instance.
