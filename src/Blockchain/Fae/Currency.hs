Module: Blockchain.Fae.Currency
Description: A typeclass for currency escrows in Fae
Copyright: (c) Ryan Reich, 2017-2018
License: MIT
Maintainer: ryan.reich@gmail.com
Stability: experimental

The primary motivating example of a smart contract is a currency such as
Bitcoin.  This module provides a typeclass for currency values that can be safely exchanged through the Fae smart contract system.
